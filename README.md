## I know it's messy, working on that

I am collecting things I've been working on, either in my actual job or in my sparetime

Most will be in R, though hopefully you'll start seeing more python soon!

### What's in here

#### Spatial Segmentation
Most of the R scripts refer to hedonic regressions I am using to build a consumer segmentation method for emerging markets (Delhi, Shanghai, and Shenzhen are currently covered)
